# mn
Some useful python functions for creating and manipulating sounds. Examples using the mn.py library are contained in the scripts sdt.py, play_seq.py, and repetition_pitch.py. The two first are demonstrations of basic psychophysical methods, the third shows how to generate repetition pitch stimuli, to be used in one of the individual assignments of the course *Applied Psychophysics using Python and R* (fall semester 2017, Department of Psychology, Stockholm University).
